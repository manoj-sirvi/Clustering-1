# Clustering
Implementation of some well known clustering algorithms and their analysis.

- `football.csv` has the information about 18K football players and their different features, abilities and skills in the game including other attributes like their club, nationality, height etc.

- `1_data_visualization.ipynb`  contains visualizations of the information in csv files.
- `2_KMeans.ipynb` contains implementation of Kmeans clustering algorithm from scratch without the use of any inbuilt libraries.
- `3_Agglomerative.ipynb` contains implementation of Agglomerative hierarchical clustering.
- `3_Divisive.ipynb` contains implementation of Divisive hierarchical clustering.
- `4_DBSCAN.ipynb` contains implementation of DBSCAN clustering algorithm.
- `Report.pdf` contains our detailed analysis on all the tasks and their comparison.

All the implementations have the initial code of data cleaning same. After each cell, some print statements are added to show the progress of the code.

To visualize the clusters in 2D, `PCA` was used for dimensionality reduction.
